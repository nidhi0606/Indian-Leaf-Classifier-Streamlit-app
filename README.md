# 🌿 GreenLeaf – Indian Plant Recognition App
 GreenLeaf is an intelligent, eco-conscious app designed to identify Indian plant species from leaf images using advanced computer vision and deep learning.
 It supports environmental awareness, sustainable farming, and biodiversity conservation.
 Overview
GreenLeaf brings the rich biodiversity of Indian flora to your fingertips. Users can take a picture of a leaf, and the app predicts the plant species, supporting:
Identification of medicinal and native Indian plants
Sustainable agriculture practices
Community environmental education
Monitoring plant health and disease detection

🔍 Approach
GreenLeaf uses a hybrid approach combining traditional image processing and deep learning:
Handcrafted Features – Leaf shape, color, and texture descriptors for baseline classification.
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) – Automatically learn complex patterns for faster and more accurate recognition.
We use the Indian Plant Leaf Dataset, containing high-quality images with clean backgrounds. Noise-filtering and masking techniques improve real-world applicability.

🌿 Sustainability & Impact
GreenLeaf is designed with a mission for ecological and social impact:
Educates users about plant conservation
Supports native plant cultivation and awareness
Enables researchers and enthusiasts to catalog Indian biodiversity
Encourages sustainable environmental practices
