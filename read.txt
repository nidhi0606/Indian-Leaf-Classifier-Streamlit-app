**GreenLeaf** is an intelligent, eco-conscious app designed to identify Indian plant species from leaf images using advanced computer vision and deep learning. It supports environmental awareness, sustainable farming, and biodiversity conservation.

---

## üå± Overview

GreenLeaf brings the rich biodiversity of Indian flora to your fingertips. Users can take a picture of a leaf, and the app predicts the plant species, supporting:

* Identification of **medicinal and native Indian plants**
* **Sustainable agriculture** practices
* Community **environmental education**
* Monitoring plant **health and disease detection**

---

## üîç Approach

GreenLeaf uses a hybrid approach combining traditional image processing and deep learning:

1. **Handcrafted Features** ‚Äì Leaf shape, color, and texture descriptors for baseline classification.
2. **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** ‚Äì Automatically learn complex patterns for faster and more accurate recognition.

We use the **Indian Plant Leaf Dataset**, containing high-quality images with clean backgrounds. Noise-filtering and masking techniques improve real-world applicability.

## üåø Sustainability & Impact

GreenLeaf is designed with a mission for ecological and social impact:

* Educates users about **plant conservation**
* Supports **native plant cultivation** and awareness
* Enables researchers and enthusiasts to **catalog Indian biodiversity**
* Encourages **sustainable environmental practices**

---

## ‚ö° Installation & Deployment

**Requirements:** Python 3.8+

Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/GreenLeaf.git
cd GreenLeaf
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you want, I can also **create a fully formatted version with emojis, badges for build/tests, and Indian plant dataset links**, so it looks like a ready-to-publish GitHub repository.

Do you want me to do that?
